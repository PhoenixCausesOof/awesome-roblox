# Contributing 

Do you want to contribute? That'd be lovely!

The goal is to have mostly projects that are stable and useful to many users.

# How?

The easiest way is to go to https://github.com/PhoenixCausesOof/awesome-roblox/blob/main/README.md and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request.

If you wish to add a new entry to the `README.d`, consider this:

* is entry significant overall?
* * It must be more substantial than small scripts or a few individual assets. Resources that are not significant enough, too specific / not useful to many people, or too low quality do not belong here.
* if you want to add something, please use the template `[RESOURCE](APPROPRIATE_LINK) â€” DESCRIPTION`
* * Since the resource might be available from many sources, prioritize the most accessible, most comprehensible one.
* pay attention to the alphabetical ordering!

# Removing projects

Don't remove projects unless they are outright broken or pronounced deprecated by another project or by its author.
